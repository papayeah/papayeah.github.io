                    <p>Some buttons don't work yet, some copy isn't written. As you're looking, please take note of what catches your eye. What size is your monitor? Would you change the order of projects? What do you want to see more/less of? There are many invisible authors who have a hand in this site's making. Including each of you. Maybe that will be an addition, some kind of digital memorial of everyone who's shared feedback.
