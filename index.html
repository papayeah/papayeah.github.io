                    <p>Design begins with typography. From this copy I'm regularly revisiting, to most of these portals into my projects. Therein you'll see how I use motion, branding, illustration, and photography to express each work. Please take note of what catches your eye, I'll be asking. There are many invisible authors who have a hand in this site's making. 
                    <br><br>That's in the works: A digital memorial of everyone who's shared something towards this site.
                    <br><br>One person is Pria Ravichandran—for this beautiful typeface, Catamaran.
                    <br><br>Thank you for visiting.</p>
