                    <p>"To make things which don't collect dust," is my first principle as a designer. To do so, I continue to study and refine typography. Other practices include motion, art direction, and UI/UX. The sum of these sensibilities are here—I designed and coded this website myself.<br><br>Special thanks to Pria Ravichandran for designing this beautiful typeface, Catamaran.</p>

                    <p>This advice rings in my ears these days. It's been one year. One year mincing one question—whether to specialize or generalize? After four particular interviews, hours of conversation with mentors, and months of reflection—this is the result.<br><br>I'm still a specialist at heart—I have a lot of fun doing a few things well. Yet there are other skills and experiences which demand our intention. Maybe the question about balance is flawed. Maybe we've been tricked. Maybe we've been both all along.<br><br>What do you think? You're here, so we're in touch. Let's talk about it, whether to specialize or generalize, and pull each other's hair out in the process.</p>
