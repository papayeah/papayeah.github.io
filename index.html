After four particular interviews, hours of conversation with mentors, and months of reflection—this is the result.<br><br>I'm still a specialist at heart—I have a lot of fun doing a few things well. Yet there are other skills and experiences which demand our intention. Maybe the question about balance is flawed. Maybe we've been tricked. Maybe we've been both all along.<br><br>What do you think? You're here, so we're in touch. Let's talk about it, whether to specialize or generalize, and pull each other's hair out in the process.</p>
