                       I'm Ibrahim—a designer specializing in branding, motion, and typography; communicating complex ideas in lively ways. When I'm not working, you'll find me volunteering in local relief projects, practicing perfect lettering flourishes, and arranging all the food groups onto one plate.<br><br>

                       Thank you to each person for your suggestions, criticisms, and praise in this site's making. It's like having pen-pals all over the world, gathering to talk in this corner of the internet.<br><br>
