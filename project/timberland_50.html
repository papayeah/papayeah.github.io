                        <h4>Problem</h4>
                        <p>Timberland 50 is the campaign for Timberland's 50th anniversary. Yes, the company is an icon among its people and the product functions extraordinarily. No, the boot does not capture all the boot stands for (see what I did there?). Now, Timberland collaborates with six artists in its Future73 campaign to outline the vision of the boot—celebrating Nathan Strauss's original intention in 1973.</p><br>
    
                        <h4>Approach</h4>
                        <p>The keystone of Timberland's voice lies in its origins: Blood, sweat, and tears. My role was to create a suite of motion assets which reflected this attitude using the various campaign logotypes. Different movement evokes different emotions and moods, thus tuning the animations to reflect Timberland in any context was key.</p><br>
                        
                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                        <p>The resulting library of motion assets took form using Timberland's signature colors, and accessibility for designers and project managers alike to use. Transitioning between Timberland and the subsequent campaign happened in a burst of energy and settling gracefully. This elegance is the same yield one who devotes their livelihood to their craft.</p>
