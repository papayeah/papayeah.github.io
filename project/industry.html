                    <h4>Idea</h4>
                    <p>INDUSTRY is a Portland-based company serving the local community via its global work. <a href = "https://industry1.org/" target = "_blank" class = "mail">INDUSTRY ONE</a> is an on-entry representation of artists who do not categorically fit the historical art gallery box. For both of these internal projects, my role was the art direction and translation of ideas into motion design which reflects our intentions.</p><br>

                    <h4>Approach</h4>
                    <p>Translating intentions into visual representation has always been my hurdle—as a motion designer, it's critical to think beyond the first great idea. We're going places, fast. Creating a container which reflects the company's pursuit for representation and thinking was the first step. The principle informing the promo's and gallery's identities. In the promo, the primary video treatments were glitchy visual and aural transitions between the footage and the co-founder's monologue. In the gallery, the key visual motif is the space itself; a personification of each artists' voice, attitude, and process. For both, most of the work was already done. Thus, abstracted components of each process became building blocks for each subsequent identity.</p><br>
                    
                    <h4>Delivery</h4>
                    <p>The result is a motion design system used across post-production, press, and social media. For the promotional video, the goal to merge the glitch motif with the typography was achieved by a CCTV-like treatment. In INDUSTRY ONE, the use of black/white and high-contrast typography (the flourishing serif and economic sans-serif) is a container highlighting each artists' work.</p><br>

                    <h4>Learning</h4>
                    <p>In each project, I learned how to simplify complex concepts in my head into easily transmitted ideas through iteration and lengthy conversations with my teams. As such, it's become easier to communicate possibilities by cutting the fat early and speaking directly to the core idea.</p>
