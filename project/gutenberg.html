                    <h4>Idea</h4>
                    <p>
                        <a href = "https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>is home to the first eBook, created on July 4, 1971 by Michael Hart. Whose mission is to facilitate the creation and distribution of eBooks for all. Since its inception, the group has remained committed to its mission—the visual design left to communicate function over expression.<br><br>
                        The potential for solidifying Project Gutenberg's original intention within its visual design system is one thing. Expanding it across social media and global in-person community projects is the fundamental ideal. To Gutenberg's dedicated volunteers, 30,000+ daily readers, and the undiscovered writers, makers, and builders.

                    <h4>Approach</h4>
                    <p>
                        Delving into the idealism encompassing Gutenberg, I was drawn in by the founder's commitment to proliferating eBooks as a means and an end. This principle became the foundation for the visual design system—using Redaction as the primary typeface, whose "weights" change its letterforms by reducing their resolution to represent time; which lead to the use of Century Gothic as the secondary typeface for its geometry and legeibility. Thereafter, the colors (variations of the familiar RGB), layout grid (using the logotype as a base), and graphic elements (playful proofreaders' marks).

                    <h4>Delivery</h4>
                    <p>The result is C.</p>
