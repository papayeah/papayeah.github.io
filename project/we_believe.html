                        <br><h4>Problem</h4>
                        <p>INDUSTRY is a global strategy and creative agency located in Portland, co-founded by Oved Valadez—the subject in this vignette.</p><br>
    
                        <h4>Approach</h4>
                        <p>The concept for the agency's promotional video is [this]. The research began with finding an appropriate glitch—studying old CCTV footage and data-moshing techniques. Then setting aside the references and beginning to play with settings, tweaking textures, and adjusting timing.</p><br>
                        
                        
                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                        <p>The result is a montage stitching together</p>
