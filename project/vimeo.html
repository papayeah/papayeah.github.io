                    <p><br><strong>Role:</strong> Design, Art Direction
                    <br><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <h4>Idea</h4>
                    <p>Today in 2024, Vimeo is having an identity crisis. The website has had 2 major makeovers, the focus remains on an indistinguishable product/service, and it's desperate to be <strike>relevant</strike> AI-powered.<br><br>
                    
                    We're at the center of what we make. Each video is a window into that user's perspective. There's slews of jocks, preps, metalheads, artists, environmentalists, hippies, and nerds. Then there's you—newbie on a mission, or awkwardly smiling your way into trouble. Either way, you'll figure out your place.</p><br>

                    <h4>Approach</h4>
                    <p>Then, Vimeo = video + me.<br>
                    Now, Vimeo: You & We.<br><br>
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <h4>Delivery</h4>
                    <p>From the playhead motif to the consistent concept of duality, the new visual identity system encompasses a Vimeo finally positioned. Gone are the days of scribbled logotypes and arbitrarily awarded badges. The brand is now a container for its community. Introducing existing users to new, genre-specific content or discussion boards for guilds active members.</p>
