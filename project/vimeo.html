                        <h4>Problem</h4>
                        <p>Vimeo is the fusion of video and me, yet the identity represents them—the company, the product, the perks. Yes, the brand's distinct wordmark stands out and its audience constantly uses its service. No, the brand's voice and attitude do not reflect the sentiments of its users. Now, Vimeo puts its users in the limelight and celebrates film on a grander stage.</p><br>
    
                        <h4>Approach</h4>
                        <p>The natural next step is creating a container which the user's sentiments live and breathe in. This idea is the foundational principle informing the new wordmark. The key visual motif is the circle, used to construct each letterform. Then, the components of a circle become building blocks for the subsequent identity.</p><br>
                        
                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                        <p>The resulting identity took form in letterhead and posters. One poster series expressed the company's alliance with its users, and the mission to carve out a distinct space for them. The second series highlights the information of the speculative Filmcore Festa—an event to celebrate filmcore.</p>
