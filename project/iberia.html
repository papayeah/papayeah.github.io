                    <h4>Idea</h4>
                    <p>Iberia Airlines is the flag carrier of Spain. Yes, the company stays at the forefront of fashion and continues to serve its customers. No, the airline does not reflect the vibrant culture of its country and celebrate its peoples' expression. Now, Iberia is a visual reflection worthy of carrying the flag of Spain.</p><br>

                    <h4>Approach</h4>
                    <p>The heart of Iberia remains in the hands of Spanish culture: Craftsmanship and poetry. This idea is the foundational principle which informs the handmade, custom wordmark. The key visual motif is personifying this heart through graphic elements and music choices for the subsequent identity.</p><br>
                    
                    <h4>Delivery</h4>
                    <p>The resulting identity took form as a short identity, preserving the brand's original colors, including letterhead and print media. Calligraphy accentuates the romance of poetry, pairing poets with locations in Spain. The tagline, "Iberia es tu maestranza.", says, "We're here with you, in your seat and in the world."</p>
