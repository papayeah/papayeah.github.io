                    <p><strong>Client:</strong> INDUSTRY
                    <br><strong>Role:</strong> Design, Art Direction
                    <br><strong>Year:</strong> 2023

                    <h4>Idea</h4>
                    <p>INDUSTRY is a Portland-based company which seeks to create a local impact for its people. Yes, the work focuses on global experiences and leaving an impression on its clients. No, the space does not reflect these principles physically and visually. Now, <a href = "https://industry1.org/" class = "mail">INDUSTRY ONE</a> is an upon-entry representation of artists who do not categorically fit the historical art gallery box.</p><br>

                    <h4>Approach</h4>
                    <p>The natural next step is creating a container which reflects the company's pursuit for representation. This idea is the foundational principle informing gallery's identity. The key visual motif is the space itself, a personification of each artists' voice, attitude, and process. Abstracted components of this process become building blocks for the subsequent identity.</p><br>
                    
                    <h4>Delivery</h4>
                    <p>The resulting identity took form as a suite of motion assets across post-production, mockups, and social media. The use of black/white acts as a vessel to highlight each artists' work. This juxtaposition exists in the typographic system too, between the flourishing serif and economic sans-serif typefaces.</p>
