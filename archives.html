                    <p>It's been a year. One year mincing two questions—whether I should specialize or generalize, and striking a balance between writing/image. The feedback from four particular interviews, hours of conversation with mentors, and months of reflection alongside my peers has landed me here.<br><br>I'm still a specialist at heart—I have a lot of fun doing a few things well. Yet there are other skills and experiences beyond pushing pixels which demand our intention. Maybe these balancing questions are flawed. Maybe we've been both all along.<br><br>What do you think? You're here, so we're in touch somehow. Let's talk about it, and pull each other's hair out in the process.</p>
