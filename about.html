                        This advice's settled in my psyche—but, I specialize or generalize? 
                        <br><br>I'm a specialist at heart. I have a lot of fun doing a few things well. Stirring sugar into my morning tea without letting the spoon hit the sides of the cup. Putting on my seatbelt with one hand and starting the car with the other. Flipping a whole entire omelet in the pan.
