                    This advice simmers in my psyche. It's been five years since then—ruminating on whether to specialize or generalize. To claim a specific title, or to go with the flow.
                    <br><br>I'm a specialist at heart. I have a lot of fun doing a few things well. Stirring sugar into my morning tea without letting the spoon hit the sides of the cup. Putting on my seatbelt with one hand and starting the car with the other. Finely chopping dill while scrambled eggs sizzle. Each demand my intention—to gracefully push or pull [the seatbelt] with confidence.
                    <br><br>And that's all folks! We're both—to be a designer unbound by a title is the zenith of our careers.
                    <br><br>What do you think, to specialize or to generalize?
