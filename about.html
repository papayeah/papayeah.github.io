                        This advice's settled in my psyche—but, I specialize or generalize? 
                        <br><br>I'm a specialist at heart. I have a lot of fun doing a few things well. Stirring sugar into my morning tea without letting the spoon hit the sides of the cup. Putting on my seatbelt with one hand and starting the car with the other. Flipping an entire omelet in the pan. 
                        <br><br>I design things which avoid collecting dust. (Ironic to this hallway.) Thus, learning about the nuances to talk about great work—from concept to completion—becomes my priority. Cultivating the use of tools like Illustrator, Cinema 4D, and the mighty pencil, in tandem to learning new ones (Blender, Figma, and React) is a unique reality to design.
                        <br><br>Fortunately, there's more to design than collecting new skills as they emerge on the horizon. For design to be dust-free, it must be constantly used; and beauty isn't enough. Communicating its ability via presentation and oration, teaching concepts or function through demonstration, and bringing the team together on the same page are each skills I pride myself in. Tempered by thousands of hours volunteering for non-profit organizations, from building care packages for people who are homeless to organizing communities around new missions to overseeing committees for conventions with thousands of attendees, I've honed my craft both in its practice and its delivery.
                        <br><br>What about you, are you a specialist or a generalist? <a href = "" class = "mail">Tell me more about that.</a>
