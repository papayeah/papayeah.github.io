                    <p>This advice often rings in my ears. It's been four years since then—ruminating, whether to specialize or generalize.
                    <br><br>I'm a specialist at heart. I have a lot of fun doing a few things well. Stirring sugar into my morning tea without letting the spoon hit the sides of the cup. Putting on my seatbelt with one hand. Cutting green onions thinly. Each demand intention—the ability to push and pull in the moment, with grace.
                    <br><br>At the end of each day, we're both specialists and generalists. To be a designer unbound by a title is the zenith of our career. What do you think?
                    <br><br>Let's talk about it.</p>
