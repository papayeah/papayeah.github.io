                        This advice's settled in my psyche. Should I specialize or generalize? 
                        <br><br>I'm a specialist at heart. I have a lot of fun doing a few things well. Stirring sugar into my morning tea without letting the spoon hit the sides of the cup. Putting on my seatbelt with one hand and starting the car with the other. Flipping dill + onion omelets in the aluminium pan. 
                        <br><br>What do you think—to specialize or to generalize?
